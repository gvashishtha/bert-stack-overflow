    "# Using Azure Machine Learning Pipelines for Batch Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to make predictions on large quantities of data asynchronously using the ML pipelines with Azure Machine Learning. Batch inference (or batch scoring) provides cost-effective inference, with unparalleled throughput for asynchronous applications. Batch prediction pipelines can scale to perform inference on terabytes of production data. Batch prediction is optimized for high throughput, fire-and-forget predictions for a large collection of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip**\n",
    "If your system requires low-latency processing (to process a single document or small set of documents quickly), use [real-time scoring](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-consume-web-service) instead of batch prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example will be take a digit identification model already-trained on MNIST dataset using the [AzureML training with deep learning example notebook](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/how-to-use-azureml/training-with-deep-learning/train-hyperparameter-tune-deploy-with-keras/train-hyperparameter-tune-deploy-with-keras.ipynb), and run that trained model on some of the MNIST test images in batch.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The input dataset used for this notebook differs from a standard MNIST dataset in that it has been converted to PNG images to demonstrate use of files as inputs to Batch Inference. A sample of PNG-converted images of the MNIST dataset were take from [this repository](https://github.com/myleott/mnist_png). \n",
    "\n",
    "The outline of this notebook is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a DataStore referencing MNIST images stored in a blob container.\n",
    "- Register the pretrained MNIST model into the model registry. \n",
    "- Use the registered model to do batch inference on the images in the data blob container.\n",
